This project contains all the source code for creating the github pages web site for Chris Smeal. So far, it is very sparce, but I am hoping to spend some time improving it soon.

TODOS:

- Create basic site layout
- Add code for push button deployment
- Add content for all my github projects
- Add simple reporting features for these projects including:
  - Unit test coverage
  - Summary pulled from README file
- Add basic resume somewhere
